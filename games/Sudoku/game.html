<!-- SUDOKU SHOOTER
======= Technical description =========================================
The game is done entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, without using any
game development frameworks or external libraries such as jQuery.
All of the game logic is found in the sudoku.js file. The game also
uses some CSS for animations and stuff, these can be found in styles.css.
Some CSS animations/modifications are triggered from the JavaScript code
by changing classes of elements.
Sounds are implemented as HTML5 audio elements that are then played from
the gamelogic when needed by using the function called playSound().
I tried to put all of the sudoku specific logic inside the function called
Sudoku in order to make it somewhat reusable (I don't think I managed to
do it that well in the end though - for example the Sudoku.draw() adds
eventListeners that are specifically for this game to the cell elements of
the puzzle). Functions that are defined outside the main Sudoku function
are more general or specific to this particular game.

======= How to play ===================================================
Game starts automatically as the page is loaded. The goal of the game
is to solve sudokus. The game gives you numbers and you need to shoot
them into place using the mouse. You get 3 lives for each puzzle and
the game ends when you run out of lives. You have 5 seconds to find a
place for each number. You lose a life if the timer runs out or you
miss 4 times in a row. Running out of time and wrong guesses also
cause you to lose points. Puzzles get progressively harder as you
complete them. The later puzzles will require some guessing. Saving
the game only saves the current score, difficulty and remaining lives,
the puzzles themselves are not saved.
